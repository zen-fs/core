_This document is supplemental to the license._

Feel free to reach out if you have any concerns regarding licensing. You can create a new discussion [here](https://github.com/orgs/zen-fs/discussions/new?category=q-a).

Regarding section 4(b) of version 3 of the LGPL, you are permitted to link to a copy of the LGPL and this document rather than including the full text of both.

#### Exception for web applications

You are permitted to convey the Combined Work without meeting the requirements of section 4(d) of version 3 of the LGPL if

- a) the Combined Work is only accessed by users from other computers over a network (i.e. a web application or website), and
- b) you also provide the [Corresponding Source](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html#:~:text=“Corresponding%20Source”) of The Library or an offer thereof.

This exception does not excuse or waive any other requirement of the LGPL.

The practical goal of this exception is to allow ZenFS to be used in modern web apps. For the avoidance of doubt, you are permitted to bundle and minify ZenFS in a web application. Linking to ZenFS' GitHub or npm page is sufficient to satisfy the above section (b) provided you do not modify ZenFS.

For example, in a list of libraries you could have:

> - [ZenFS](https://github.com/zen-fs/core), Licensed under the [LGPL 3.0 or later](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html) and [COPYING.md](https://github.com/zen-fs/core/blob/main/COPYING.md), Copyright © James Prevett and other ZenFS contributors

**This is a very easy requirement, please respect it.**

Before v2.4.0, ZenFS was licensed under the MIT. This still means you need to include the copyright notice and license.
