_This document is supplemental to the license._

**This is a very easy requirement, please respect it.**
Feel free to reach out if you have any concerns regarding licensing.

If you convey copies of ZenFS (including in bundles), you must meet section 4 and 5 of the license. This includes at a minimum:

- disclosure that ZenFS is in use
- linking to the GitHub or npm pages
- referencing the license and copyright.

For example, in a list of libraries you could have:

> - [ZenFS](https://github.com/zen-fs/core), LGPL-3.0-or-later, Copyright Â© James Prevett and other ZenFS contributors

<br />

Before v2.4.0, ZenFS was licensed under the MIT. This still means you need to include the copyright notice and license.
